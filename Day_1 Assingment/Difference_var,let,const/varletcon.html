        <h2>Diffrence between var,let and const</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>let == block scope</li>
            <li>var == function scope</li>
            <li>const == block scope like let but immutable</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.</li>
            <li>var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared;<br>const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</li>
            <li>They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while varvariables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.</li>
            <li>While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</li>
            <li>var is global variable,let is a local variable, const is a constant variable</li>
        </ul>
