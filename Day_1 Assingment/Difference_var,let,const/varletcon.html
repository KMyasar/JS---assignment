        <h1>Var,Let,const</h1>
        <p>$var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.</p>
        <p>$var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</p>
        <p>$They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while varvariables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.</p>
        <p>$While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</p>
        <p>$var is global variable,let is a local variable, const is a constant variable</p>
